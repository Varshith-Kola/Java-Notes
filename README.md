# Complete Java + Data Structures & Algorithms

Welcome to my comprehensive Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) notes repository! My name is Varshith, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science. This repository contains my notes, code examples, and exercises as I learn Java and various data structures and algorithms. I hope these resources will be helpful to others who are also learning these concepts.

## Course Overview

This course is a deep dive into Java programming and Data Structures & Algorithms, designed to prepare students for technical interviews and advanced studies.
