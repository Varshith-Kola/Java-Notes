# Flowcharts & Pseudocodes

### What are Flowcharts?

Flowcharts are diagrams that represent the steps of a process using symbols and arrows. They help in understanding and designing the flow of a program.

**Components of a Flowchart:**

1. **Start/End**: Represents the beginning or end of a process.
2. **Input/Output**: Represents input or output operations.
3. **Process**: Represents a process or action step.
4. **Decision**: Represents a decision point in the process.
5. **Arrows**: Indicate the flow of the process.

**Flowchart Symbols:**

### What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a simplified, half-code representation of an algorithm. It is written in plain language and helps programmers understand the steps needed to solve a problem. Pseudocode does not follow the syntax rules of any specific programming language, but instead focuses on the logic and steps of the algorithm.

**Benefits of Pseudocode:**

- **Simplifies Complexity**: Helps break down complex algorithms into understandable steps.
- **Language Agnostic**: Can be understood regardless of programming language knowledge.
- **Improves Communication**: Eases communication of ideas between programmers and non-programmers.
- **Facilitates Debugging**: Makes it easier to spot logical errors before actual coding begins.

### Examples

**1. Sum of Two Numbers:**

Pseudocode:

```
START
1. Input Number1, Number2
2. Sum = Number1 + Number2
3. Print Sum
END

```

**2. Calculate Simple Interest:**

Pseudocode:

```
START
1. Input P, R, N
2. Calculate I = (P * R * N) / 100
3. Display I
END

```

**3. Max of Three Numbers:**

Pseudocode:

```
START
1. Read A, B, C
2. If A > B then
     If A > C then
         Print "A is the largest"
     Else
         Print "C is the largest"
   Else
     If B > C then
         Print "B is the largest"
     Else
         Print "C is the largest"
END

```

**4. Find if a Number is Prime or Not:**

Pseudocode:

```
START
1. Input N
2. Let DIV = 2
3. While DIV < N do
     If N % DIV == 0 then
         Print "Not Prime"
         Exit
     Else
         Increment DIV by 1
4. Print "Prime"
END

```
