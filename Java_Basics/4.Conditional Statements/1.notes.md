# Conditional Statements in Java

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Java provides several types of conditional statements:

1. **if-else statement**
2. **else-if ladder**
3. **ternary operator**
4. **switch statement**

### 1. if-else Statement

The `if-else` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed using the `else` clause.

#### Syntax:
```java
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

#### Example:
```java
public class IfElseExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is negative or zero.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
The number is positive.
```

### 2. else-if Ladder

The `else-if` ladder allows you to chain multiple conditions together. Each condition is checked in sequence, and the first condition that evaluates to true will have its corresponding block executed.

#### Syntax:
```java
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if all conditions are false
}
```

#### Example:
```java
public class ElseIfExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 0;

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is positive.");
        } else if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is negative.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The number is zero.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
The number is zero.
```

### 3. Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement. It takes three operands: a condition, a value if the condition is true, and a value if the condition is false.

#### Syntax:
```java
variable = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

#### Example:
```java
public class TernaryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;

        String result = (number > 0) ? "The number is positive." : "The number is negative or zero.";
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
The number is positive.
```

### 4. switch Statement

The `switch` statement allows you to execute one block of code out of many based on the value of an expression. It is a cleaner way to handle multiple conditions compared to the `else-if` ladder when all conditions are based on a single variable.

#### Syntax:
```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression == value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression == value2
        break;
    // you can have any number of case statements
    default:
        // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
```

#### Example:
```java
public class SwitchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 3;
        String dayName;

        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                dayName = "Monday";
                break;
            case 2:
                dayName = "Tuesday";
                break;
            case 3:
                dayName = "Wednesday";
                break;
            case 4:
                dayName = "Thursday";
                break;
            case 5:
                dayName = "Friday";
                break;
            case 6:
                dayName = "Saturday";
                break;
            case 7:
                dayName = "Sunday";
                break;
            default:
                dayName = "Invalid day";
                break;
        }

        System.out.println("The day is: " + dayName);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
The day is: Wednesday
```

These conditional statements are fundamental in controlling the flow of your Java programs, allowing you to execute code based on various conditions and scenarios.
