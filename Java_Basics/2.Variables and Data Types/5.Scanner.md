# 5.Scanner Class

In Java, the `Scanner` class is used to take input from the user. It is part of the `java.util` package, so you need to import this package before using the `Scanner` class.

### Steps to Take Input Using Scanner

1. **Import the Scanner class**
2. **Create an instance of the Scanner class**
3. **Use the Scanner methods to read different types of input**

### 1. Import the Scanner Class

To use the `Scanner` class, you need to import it from the `java.util` package:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

### 2. Create an Instance of the Scanner Class

You need to create an instance of the `Scanner` class to read input from various input streams, such as `System.in` for standard input (keyboard):

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

### 3. Use the Scanner Methods to Read Input

The `Scanner` class provides various methods to read different types of input. Here are some commonly used methods:

- `nextInt()`: Reads an integer
- `nextDouble()`: Reads a double
- `nextLine()`: Reads a line of text
- `next()`: Reads a single word
- `nextBoolean()`: Reads a boolean value
- `nextFloat()`: Reads a float value
- `nextLong()`: Reads a long value
- `nextShort()`: Reads a short value
- `nextByte()`: Reads a byte value

### Example: Reading Different Types of Input

Here's a complete example demonstrating how to use the `Scanner` class to read different types of input:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to read input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Reading a string input
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Your name is: " + name);

        // Reading an integer input
        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Your age is: " + age);

        // Reading a double input
        System.out.print("Enter your height in meters: ");
        double height = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Your height is: " + height);

        // Reading a boolean input
        System.out.print("Are you a student (true/false): ");
        boolean isStudent = scanner.nextBoolean();
        System.out.println("Are you a student: " + isStudent);

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Handling the `nextLine()` Method

When mixing calls to `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, etc., with `nextLine()`, you may encounter unexpected behavior. This is because `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, etc., do not consume the newline character after the input. Therefore, if you use `nextLine()` immediately after these methods, it will read the leftover newline character instead of waiting for the user to input a new line.

To avoid this issue, you can use an extra `nextLine()` call to consume the newline character.

### Example Handling Newline Character

Here's an example demonstrating this scenario:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class HandlingNextLine {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        // Consume the leftover newline character
        scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Your age is: " + age);
        System.out.println("Your name is: " + name);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Output

When you run the above program, the expected output will be:

```
Enter your age: 25
Enter your name: John Doe
Your age is: 25
Your name is: John Doe

```

By using the `Scanner` class, you can easily read different types of user input in a Java program. Properly handling the newline character ensures that your input operations work as expected.
