# Comments

- Comments are used to make the code more readable and understandable. They are ignored by the Java compiler and are meant for humans who read the code. Java supports three types of comments:
    1. **Single-line comments**
    2. **Multi-line comments**
    3. **Documentation comments**

### 1. Single-line Comments

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`). Any text between `//` and the end of the line is considered a comment.

**Example:**

```java
public class CommentsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is a single-line comment
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // This comment is at the end of a line
    }
}
```

### 2. Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Any text between `/*` and `*/` is considered a comment. Multi-line comments can span multiple lines.

**Example:**

```java
public class CommentsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* This is a multi-line comment
           that spans multiple lines */
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### 3. Documentation Comments

Documentation comments start with `/**` and end with `*/`. They are used to create API documentation. The `javadoc` tool processes these comments to generate HTML documentation pages.

**Example:**

```java
/**
 * The CommentsExample class demonstrates the use of comments in Java.
 */
public class CommentsExample {

    /**
     * The main method is the entry point of the program.
     * @param args The command-line arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // Print a message to the console
    }

    /**
     * Adds two integers and returns the result.
     * @param a The first integer
     * @param b The second integer
     * @return The sum of a and b
     */
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

Using comments effectively can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code by providing context and explanations for what the code is doing.
